#### **Recommendations:**

1. **Data Cleanup**:  
   - Resolve "Blank" entries in both the country filter and region distribution. Missing information may distort insights and lead to misinformed decisions.  

2. **Regional Strategy**:  
   - Evaluate whether Europe’s larger salary distribution aligns with the organizational strategy and expected returns. If not, adjust investments to ensure balanced growth.  

3. **Talent Retention**:  
   - Conduct employee satisfaction surveys to address possible reasons for low average tenure and explore retention strategies for key contributors.

4. **Departmental Investments**:  
   - Reassess the underfunded departments like Marketing and HR to ensure they are adequately supported. These functions often play a crucial role in organizational success.
